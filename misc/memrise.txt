Things I don't like...
-when revieweing difficult words there is no link to edit the database
(from the web. There is a link when you are in normal planting or watering.)

-mobile app has no edit or ignore capability
-lost a streak when the mobile app didn't update
-what is 'today' Time zone issue, plus a lot of lag in new learning
being added

-last '24 hours' is not actually the last 24 hours.
- in web app, the progress bar is non linear. If you missed words it
will make you get them right, or something, so the progress bar maxes
out and you have an unknown number of words still to do. Sometimes this
has been enormously enormously frustrating.

-would like a 'flag this word' to make something...

-I'm fuzzy on what I want, but tools to make it easier to build a 
composite list of all of your courses.

-there is an auto ignore somewhere...
-a graph of items would be cool.
-on performance monitor in the legend add (current: nnn) next to
words in long term memory and words forgotten.

bill: they are doing a biopsy on his kidney, so he has to be 
off of a blood thinner, which is an issue. Today they go to 
a cardiologist, hopefully that dr. can let them know what treatment
he might be able to take. An enzyme inhibitor which would slow the
cancer, it might buy him a year. except for the swelling he is not
in any pain. He is living in a very good place.

Molly has been amazing with him.

uprise is an app which works with memrise to edit courses.
It is cool.

the database is sqlite3 it is in 
/Library/Application Support/Uprise/Data/Uprise.sqlite

Liya is a useful tool for database exploration.

select zrow,zindex, zvalue from zdbentry where zrow=650 order by zrow, zindex;

And the umlauts and s sett's are maintained so yay.
