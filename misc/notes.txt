Protip! To pronounce an umlaut 'ü' just form your lips to pronounce an 'i', but say a 'u'. (Works for 'ä' and 'ö' as well.)

Manuel Werner Bräuer In San Francisco I explained it that way: "To make it sound Austrian, just let go of every kind of motivation in your body." It worked.

TILT - from a facebook post by Kari Rauschen where she used the word
muell and I could only find Müll and then I was enlightened.

ü - can be replaced with ue
ä - can be replaced with ae
ö - can be replaced with oe
